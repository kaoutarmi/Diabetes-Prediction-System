# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction** project! 🎉 The goal of this project is to predict whether a person has diabetes using various **machine learning algorithms**. We focus on applying data cleaning, visualization, and modeling techniques to build accurate prediction models.

## 🎯 Objective

- 🧹 **Clean the data** to ensure high-quality inputs.
- 📊 **Visualize the data** to better understand patterns and correlations.
- 🤖 **Train machine learning models** to predict diabetes.
- 💡 **Evaluate model performance** using several evaluation metrics.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧼: Removing missing values, handling outliers, and preparing the data for modeling.
2. **Data Visualization** 📊: Analyzing and visualizing the data to understand patterns and trends.
3. **Machine Learning Modeling** 🤖: Training multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

1. **Logistic Regression** 🧑‍💼
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🔲
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🔍
4. **Random Forest Classifier** 🌳
5. **Naive Bayes** 🧑‍🔬
6. **Gradient Boosting** 🔥

## 📈 Model Evaluation Methods Used

1. **Accuracy Score** ✅: Measures how often the model makes correct predictions.
2. **ROC AUC Curve** 📉: Evaluates the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
3. **Cross-Validation** 🔄: Splitting the data into different subsets to ensure the model performs well on unseen data.
4. **Confusion Matrix** 📊: Provides a breakdown of prediction errors, including false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.
